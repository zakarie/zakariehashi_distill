I have made a couple of attempts to get a consistent blog going, however all have failed for one reason or another. 
This is my latest attempt which was inspired by the great [`distill`](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) package by the Rstudio team. 
I often found I would spend a disproportionate amount of time fiddling with how the site looked, rather than putting time and effort into the content. 
Distill provides a clean and simple style which really appealed to me straight out of the box, so I'm hoping that I'll be able to focus more on the content this time around.
I have a few ideas in the pipeline that I'll hopefully share over the coming months.

Will this time be different? Only time will tell...
