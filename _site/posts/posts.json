    "contents": "\nI wanted to share a cool knitr trick I recently discovered thanks to this excellent SO post.\nThe problem\nYou have some data that has many groups.\nYou want to fit a model and create a plot of the result for each group.\nYou want to create a pdf output that has each plot for each group on a new page, with the correct figure title and list of figures.\nYou don’t want to write each code chunk out manually.\nThe solution\nFor a quick demonstration, lets use the survival::verteran dataset. We want to fit a survival model for each celltype and use ggsurvplot to create a survival curve for each model. Finally we want to print out each of the plots on a new page in a pdf document.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(survival)\nlibrary(survminer)\n\n# fit model for each celltype\n\nby_celltype <- veteran %>% \n  nest_by(celltype) %>% \n  mutate(model = list(survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ trt, data = data)),\n         plot = list(ggsurvplot(model, data = data)),\n         name = str_glue(\"Survival curve by treatmeant for celltype: {celltype}\"))\n\n\n\nIf you haven’t seen nest_by in action before, I’d highly recommend checking out this dplyr article.\nNext we extract the list-column by_celltype$plot as a list, and give each element the name that was created using str_glue in the previous step.\n\n\nall_plots <- as.list(by_celltype$plot)\n\nnames(all_plots) <- by_celltype$name\n\nnames(all_plots)\n\n\n[1] \"Survival curve by treatmeant for celltype: squamous\" \n[2] \"Survival curve by treatmeant for celltype: smallcell\"\n[3] \"Survival curve by treatmeant for celltype: adeno\"    \n[4] \"Survival curve by treatmeant for celltype: large\"    \n\nThese will be used as our figure captions in the pdf.\nIn this final step, we can pass in the names of the list to the fig.cap option in the knitr chunk, and set results = 'asis' like so\n```{r fig.cap=names(all_plots), results='asis'}\n```\n\nIn that chunk we can use a loop that prints each element in our list (in this case our plots) and also a \\newpage command after each plot.\nNote that we need to use two \\\\ in order escape the single \\ in markdown.\n\n\nfor(plot in names(all_plots)){\n  print(all_plots[[plot]])\n  cat('\\\\newpage')\n}\n\n\n\nBelow is an example of the output.\n\n\nNow, this was only with three groups, so it probably wouldn’t have been too much trouble to write out manually. However with 50 or 100 groups, this workflow can come in very handy!\nAcknowledgments\nAll thanks goes to Michael Harper for his great answer to this stack overflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52788015/looping-through-a-list-of-ggplots-and-giving-each-a-figure-caption-using-knitr\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nI have made a couple of attempts to get a consistent blog going, however all have failed for one reason or another. This is my latest attempt which was inspired by the great distill package by the Rstudio team. I often found I would spend a disproportionate amount of time fiddling with how the site looked, rather than putting time and effort into the content. Distill provides a clean and simple style which really appealed to me straight out of the box, so I’m hoping that I’ll be able to focus more on the content this time around. I have a few ideas in the pipeline that I’ll hopefully share over the coming months.\nWill this time be different? Only time will tell…\n\n\n\n\n\n",
